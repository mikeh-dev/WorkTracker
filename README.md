### Work Order App
This is a simple application (for now) to manage work orders for a vehicle conversion business.

# Three main goals for this app:
- Manage work orders and delegate to production team

- Manage vehicle images to give the business some digital history of the vehicles they've worked on, the condition they were in on arrival, and the condition they were in on delivery.

- Give the customer and other teams members a place to track the progress of work orders.

# Eventually, I'd like to add a few more features:
- Notifications for Production Team when a new work order is created or updated.
- Notifications for Customer when a work order is updated or completed.
- A calendar to help with scheduling for production team.
- Google Calendar integration to sync with the business's calendar.
- API Integration with Business Software to sync work orders with Sales Ordes and Production Jobs
